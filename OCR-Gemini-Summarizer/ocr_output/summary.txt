This code snippet uses scikit-learn's `train_test_split` function to divide a dataset (presumably from a pandas DataFrame `df`) into training and testing sets.  The features (`x`) consist of 'ApplicantIncome', 'CoapplicantIncome', 'LoanAmount', and 'Property Area' columns, while the target variable (`y`) is 'Credit_History'.  The dataset is split into 80% training data (293 samples) and 20% testing data (74 samples), using a random seed of 42 for reproducibility.
