This code snippet uses scikit-learn's `train_test_split` function to divide a dataset (presumably from a pandas DataFrame called `df`) into training and testing sets.  The features (`x`) consist of 'ApplicantIncome', 'CoapplicantIncome', 'LoanAmount', and 'Property Area' columns, while the target variable (`y`) is 'Credit_History'.  The dataset is split into an 80% training set (293 samples) and a 20% testing set (74 samples) using a random state of 42 for reproducibility.
